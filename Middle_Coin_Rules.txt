** Middle coin **

* At the start of each round, each player places a deposit of 5 units. 
Example: if there are 5 players, the total units on table are 25.

* Each player is then given 2 tokens by the dealer at the start of each round. There are total of 100 tokens in the game. 
The 2 tokens define the range for you. Token 1 is starting number, token 2 is ending number. 
 
* The dealer next picks a token randomly from the remaining tokens on the table. 
 
* If this token falls in between the 2 tokens you have been dealt with. You win the bet. 
 
* So, Before the dealer picks the token randomly, depending on the 2 tokens you have, you have to make a  bet, if the number which is yet to be picked by the dealer would be in between the tokens you have. 
Example: if you have been dealt with tokens 2, 99. There are 97 numbers in between, which means you are more likely to win. 
If you have been dealt with 2,5. You have fewer chances to win. 
 
*The bet amount has to be lesser than the amount which is on the table at the point. 
Example: if there are 5 players. Each deposited 5 units. There are 25 units on table. 
The player can bet only upto 25 units. If he wins the bet. He gets all the 25 units. If he looses, he has to add 25 more units to the table. 
 
* Once any player wins, the round is completed. The units left (if any, by the end of the round) on the table are passed onto the next round. 
 
* At the start of next round, players will have to deposit 5 units again.
